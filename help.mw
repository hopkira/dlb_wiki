DLBC is very much a collaboration between people, academia and industry.  We have voluntary contributors all around the world. At the moment our focus is collecting stories about the digital divide and we'd love your help in collecting them.

==Please help us collect stories==
We are asking your assistance in collecting stories about the digital divide. These stories will help us review and validate the [[Taxonomy|taxonomy]], and identify any gaps. They will also help us create personas to bring the revised taxonomy to life.

===Our target groups===
We're focusing on  three targeted groups that are affected by the COVID-19 crisis and that may find it difficult to access/use technology. We have developed interview guides to help you collect these stories, which are linked as Word files. In these guides, we've included questions that will help facilitate discussions. 

The three groups are:

# Children being homeschooled as a result of COVID policies or concerns and their families (Interview Guide: [https://www.dlbc.info/images/c/ca/Interview_Children.docx Interview Guide for Homeschooling children and families])
# Persons living alone who are isolated due to COVID restrictions or protection (Interview Guide: [https://www.dlbc.info/images/d/d9/Interview_Alone.docx Interview Guide for People without Permanent Residence and Outreach Workers])
# People without a permanent residence (migrant workers, those experiencing homelessness), affected by COVID, and social workers / outreach workers who work with them (Interview Guide: [https://www.dlbc.info/images/a/af/Interview_Migrant.docx Interview Guide for People without Permanent Residence and Outreach Workers])

===Sending us your results===
Once completed, please send the documents to [mailto:dlbcacademy@gmail.com dlbcacademy@gmail.com] . If you have any questions, you can reach out to us at the same email address, and one of us will get back to you within one working day (working days: Monday-Friday UK time).

We would appreciate it if you could get us a story from any one of these groups. Every single submission helps. It would be great if you could send any stories back to us by '''the end of March 2022'''.

===Some simple rules to follow===
'''Note: This is not a formal research project - we do not have Institutional Review Board approval.''' We'd like to ask you to follow a few simple rules that are part of good ethical practice.

* When you send us your stories, please redact any information that can be used to identify the person that you interviewed. 
* If you are recording the interview session to assist you in your documentation, you must receive permission prior to recording and destroy the recording after you document the responses and the interview is completed. 
* You must obtain the individual's permission if you are documenting any quotes from them.
